# Total-Rickall
A simple game based on the 'Total Rickall' episode of Rick & Morty. If you've never seen it, I highly recommend watching it.

* The purpose of building this game was to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* I pulled data from a public Rick & Morty API https://rickandmortyapi.com/ using an AJAX GET request.
* I have also used jQuery and Bootstrap. 

I plan on rebuilding this game using React as I believe it would run much smoother.

Thank you,
Zara
