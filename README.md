# Total-Rickall
A simple game based on the 'Total Rickall' episode of Rick & Morty. If you've never seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it.

* The purpose of building this game has been to learn and practice new skills as a developer.
* This game has been created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* I pulled data from a public Rick & Morty API https://rickandmortyapi.com/ using an AJAX GET request.
* I also used the jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks. 

Please help me improve my code, helping me to learn.

Thank you,
Zara
