# Total-Rickall
A simple game based on the 'Total Rickall' episode of Rick & Morty. If you've never seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it.

* The purpose of building this game has been for me to learn as a developer and gain practice.
* This game has been created with HTML, CSS and Javascript languages.
* I have pulled data from a public Rick & Morty API https://rickandmortyapi.com/ using an AJAX GET request.
* I have also used the jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.
